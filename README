This repo is for a 2D implementation of RKPM written by Mathew Reynolds in December of 2016. 

Code Structure:
   Primary Classes:
      -QuadMesh: Defines background mesh. Uses a 2D FEM mesh with shape functions. This provides a robust mechanism to retrieve the spatial cordinates and jacobian value for an arbitrary isoparametric element.
      -GridRectangle: Defines the Nodes and Connectivity for a 2D rectangular mesh.
      -Boundary: Assigns nodes as a boundary value in an output array.
      -Quadrature: Quadrature tables in 1D and 2D. 2D tables are organized as the tensor product to reduce loops later.
      -Cloud: Defines a could of RKPM Nodes.
